# dbt Resolves Data Chaos, Through Standards

- Data transformation: "a cohesive arc moving data from _source-conformed_ to _business-conformed_ " (`dbt` blog)

- Data have idiosyncrasies, so transformations easily adopt adhoc designs

  - Adhoc designs cost high cognitive load in maintenance, collaboration ...
  - 2x trouble if that design is not your payload ("load that pays")
  - Design standards will cost time

- Standards save cognitive load, for spending elsewhere (direct-to-payload)  

- dbt standardizes the data transformation workflow, overcoming challenges
  - [historically](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/it-s-time-for-open-source-analytics/) 
  - currently

# dbt Standardizes Tooling, and also Philosophy

- dbt Core tool is incredible
  - `dbt build` -- 'nuff said.

- dbt blog shares the "real secrets" (principles, "philosophy"):
  - How to clearly structure a complex data project
  - How to unlock tool's full potential -- should be required reading!
  
- In my Data Science experience:
  - I will compose data transformations (that's [good](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/))
  - Non-standard workflows are hard to maintain and extend
      - Does design enforce, modular & orthogonal components? 
      - For new reader, or your future self, what's time-to-understanding (_Art of Readable Code_)?

# Philosophy: Standard Workflow Layers, Details 

- Philosophy articulates,
  - Transformation workflow as standard _layers_
  - Overarching conventions for implementation, style

- Reminds of [normconf](https://normconf.com/) content

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gonna start a conference called <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NormIPS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NormIPS</a> that’s just presentations of middlebrow ML topics. “how to structure Python packages 2022”, “how many k-folds is too many”, “how to make the browser pop-up come up when the notebook is done running”, “putting features in Postgres”, etc.</p>&mdash; Vicki (@vboykis) <a href="https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1552066833582276610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

# Standard Layers Structure a Workflow

- **"Stacking our transformation in optimized, modular layers means
we can apply each transformation in only one place"**
  - Remarkable -- contrast to decision burden in adhoc approaches

- Staging: atomic building blocks

- Intermediate: transformation steps

- Marts: business-meaningful entities

- Probably not your workflow version 1
  - "With a functioning model flowing in dbt, 
  we can start refactoring and optimizing that mart."
  - Add this complexity as necessary!

---

# A Few Properties Tell a Layer's Story

- Folder structure
  - "Folder structure is also one of the key interfaces
  for understanding the knowledge graph encoded in our project [...]
  It should reflect how the data flows, step-by-step,
  from a wide variety of source-conformed models into 
  fewer, richer business-conformed models."

- File names
  - "By descriptively labeling the transformations happening [within model ...],
  even a stakeholder who doesn't know SQL would be able to grasp 
  the purpose of this section"

- Typical operations
  - Manage complexity by breaking out small steps

---

# Staging Layer: Atomic Building Blocks

- Folder structure
  - One subdirectory per source system (Stripe, transactions database, etc)

- File names
  - Layer, source system, entity (plural): `stg_[source]__[entity]s.sql`

- Typical operations
  - Rename
  - Change data types
  - Univariate transforms
      - Converting units
      - Discretizing/bucketizing
  - NOT joins (layer not dedicated for integrations)
  - NOT aggregations

---

# Intermediate Layer: Transformation Steps

- Folder structure
  - One subdirectory per business area (finance, marketing, etc)

- File names
  - Layer, entity (plural), transform action: `int_[entity]s_[verb]s.sql`
  - Emphasize business-conformed concept over source system
  - "easy for **anybody** to quickly understand 
  what's happening in that model"

- Typical operations
  - Change of data grain
      - Table pivot
      - Aggregations
      - Joins

---

# Mart Layer: Business-Meaningful Entities

- Folder structure
  - One subdirectory per business area (finance, marketing, etc)
  - Not to encourage, same concept calculated differently per team
      - Good: `tax_revenue`, `revenue`
      - Not good: `finance_revenue`, `marketing_revenue`

- File names
  - Entity: `[entity]s.sql`
  - "for pure marts, there should not be a time dimension [...]
  typically best captured via metrics"

- Typical operations
  - Joins
  - Wide array of calculations -- though limited count
      - Many calculations imply, opportunity for upstream move

---

# Test-Driven Data Transformation

- At least `unique` and `not_null` tests, for every model
  - How else to be confident that, a revision maintains existing functionality?

- Might write tests first, a la Test-Driven Development 

- Broadly applicable practice, whether in dbt project or Jupyter notebook

---

# Code Readability is an Objective to Optimize

- "**DO NOT OPTIMIZE FOR FEWER LINES OF CODE**"
  - Again, _Art of Readable Code_
  
- Leverage CTE early and often
  - Import-type (a la Python package imports)
  - Logical-type (break down complexity)
  
---

# We Can Bring Order to Naming, Broadly

- Already covered table names

- `snake_case` for schema, table, and column naming

- Full name > domain-specific abbreviation
  - Consider onboarding employee
  - "Code should be written to minimize the time it would take
  for someone else to understand it" (_Art of Readable Code_)

- Timestamp columns `<event>_at`, date columns `<event>_date`

- True/false columns `is_<condition>`

# Interface Simplicity is Exemplary 

- Well-encapsulated API: one command line statement accomplishes goal
  - `dbt build`
      - Specific to machine learning: resist ["pipeline jungle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr3_DQ-RhTc)
  - `dbt docs generate`
  - `dbt docs serve`
    
- Low-visual noise interfaces for configuration
  - yaml files

# dbt Inspires More SWE in Analytics

- dbt emphasizes _connection_ of data analytics, software engineering

- This connection should revolutionize more of analytics!

- Some examples from my work...

# Motivate One Workflow for ML Feature Transforms 

- Business stakeholders and data practitioners often unhappy with 
cost of reaching baseline predictive model
  - Even with analyst-friendly data in hand
  
- Analyst-friendly data need transformed to model-ready features
  - _Feature transform workflow/pipeline_
  
- Workflow rewrites common between or within- projects

---

# model-flow: One Workflow for ML Feature Transforms 

- **Solution: de-couple standard (a) operations, (b) project-specific configuration**

# model-flow Usage

- Compose a few fun-to-read configuration files
  - "What data are used in this analysis?"
  - "What transformation steps yield model-ready data?"

- Get model-ready data with a command line statement:

.center[
```python -m src.features.main```
]

- Transformed data could pass to many possible models

# Data Opportunities Abound Outside Formal Tech

- Consider a conventionally anecdotal marketplace
  - Our example: baseball cards
  
- Expect high friction in asset valuation precedent
  - time-intensive, 
  - hard-to-scale,
  - inaccurate

- With the internet, relevant data abound -- just needs wrangled!
  
- With our data and predictive models, we 
  - Save sellers time spent during listing process,
  - Inform buyers about fundamental value drivers (performance _and_ card details) 

- We're building in public, [@SchoolhouseData](https://twitter.com/SchoolhouseData)
